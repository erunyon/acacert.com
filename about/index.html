<p>American Certification Agency for Healthcare Professionals is a voluntary, non-governmental, national certification agency established to recognize those practitioners who have attained a standard of knowledge through structured programs or work experience. ACA is committed to meeting the changing and dynamic needs of the healthcare environment by offering examinations to practitioners to validate one or several skill areas.</p>

<p>The mission of ACA is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish guidelines by which individuals may demonstrate competence in their discipline through certification testing.</li>
  <li>Establish recertification guidelines through current continuing education in a given discipline.</li>
  <li>Provide a mechanism by which individuals who wish to enter, continue, and/or advance in their discipline by certification testing, adhere to the highest ethical standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ACA advisory board consists of healthcare professionals who periodically review certification requirements and examinations to assure uniform enforcement. The competency based examinations are written and peer reviewed by practicing healthcare professionals and educators to assure comprehensiveness and validity.</p>
