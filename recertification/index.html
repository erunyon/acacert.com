<h2>WHY RECERTIFY?</h2>
<p>Unlike some organizations which offer automatic, lifetime certification, ACA offers you the opportunity to demonstrate continuing competency through recertification. Healthcare is constantly changing and you stay current with the latest technological and governmental changes by participating in continuing education activities. ACA recertification demonstrates to everyone that you are a serious professional interested in maintaining your level of expertise.</p>

<h2>HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CE YOU NEED TO RECERTIFY?</h2>
<p>You are required to complete 0.5 continuing education hours per month since you became certified. One hour of continuing education credit equals one contact hour of credit. For example: If you have been certified for 18 months, you need 0.5 hours x 18 months or 9 continuing education credits.</p>

<h2>WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES QUALIFY FOR CREDIT?</h2>
<p>A variety of professional and educational activities can earn the necessary credits needed to recertify. If you have any questions about whether an activity qualifies for credit, please contact ACA.</p>
