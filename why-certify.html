<h2>Value of Certification Statement</h2>
<p><strong>Credentialing</strong> is an overarching term that includes processes, policies, and practices that support credentials such as a license, registration, certification, qualification, or assessment-based certificate to demonstrate that an organization or individual has met predetermined and standardized criteria. Given the range of terms, different interpretations and distinctions between mandatory versus voluntary requirements among these credentials, can create confusion. This document serves as the first in a series of brief statements that clarify and communicate the value of credentials to stakeholders, beginning with certification.</p>
<p><strong>Certification</strong> is a process by which an entity grants formal recognition to individuals that meet predetermined, standardized criteria. The certification process involves determination of eligibility, an assessment of demonstration of competence, and requirements for regular recertification. Certification is usually voluntary and established by a non-governmental entity.</p>
<p><strong>Value of Certification:</strong> A high-quality certification validates an individualâ€™s knowledge, skills, and abilities in a defined profession, occupation, skill, or role.
